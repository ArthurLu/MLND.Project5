### Project Highlights
  * Explored each feature in a thoroughly way and gave detailed observation.
  * Explained each used algorithm in laymanâ€™s terms and gave the whole though process of refining.
  * Provided visualization to emphasizes the important qualities about data with thorough discussion.

### General Descriptions
  Facebook and Kaggle launched a machine learning engineering competition of identifying
the correct place for check ins, which is a supervised classification problem. For giving a flavor of what it takes to work with real data, Facebook created an artificial world consisting of more than 100,000 places located in a 10 km by 10 km square and data was fabricated to resemble location signals coming from mobile devices.
